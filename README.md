# MALARIA-CASES-IN-AFRICA-2007-2017-
This report presents an in-depth analysis of malaria cases across African countries from 2007 to 2017. By examining patterns in total cases, incidence rates, urbanization levels, and sanitation access, this study aims to uncover key factors influencing malaria transmission and burden.

# Objectives 
- Analyze malaria case trends across African countries between 2007–2017.
- Evaluate the impact of sanitation and urbanization on disease incidence.
- Provide actionable insights for public health strategy.

# Why this project is impactful
Malaria remains one of the most persistent public health challenges in Africa, accounting for a significant proportion of global cases and deaths. Despite advancements in treatment and prevention, millions of people across the continent continue to be affected annually. Understanding the geographic, environmental, and socio-infrastructural drivers of malaria is critical for designing effective intervention strategies.

# Key findings
- From 2007 to 2017, a total of 587.6 million malaria cases were recorded across African countries, with an average of approximately 1.07 million cases per country. The year 2017 saw the highest number of reported cases (128.1 million), while 2008 recorded the lowest (9.5 million).
- The Democratic Republic of Congo had the highest overall number of cases at 77.6 million, followed by Mozambique (44.0M), Burkina Faso (41.6M), Uganda (41.1M), and Burundi (40.2M). These top five countries were primarily rural-majority and had either poor or fair levels of access to sanitation services.
- In terms of incidence rates per 1000 persons at risk, Burkina Faso recorded the highest average at 5.3k, followed by Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, Benin, and Côte d'Ivoire, each with rates around 4.5k.
- When analyzing urbanization status, countries categorized as balanced (between rural and urban) recorded the highest average malaria cases (~1.5M), followed by rural-majority countries (~1.3M). In contrast, urban majority countries had significantly fewer cases on average (~0.3M), suggesting a potential link between urban development and lower malaria transmission.
- Sanitation levels showed a strong correlation with incidence rates. Countries with poor sanitation access (0–30%) had the highest average incidence rate (274.3). As sanitation improved, incidence rates dropped: fair access (153.8), moderate access (78.3), and high access (81–100%) had an incidence rate of 0.0, highlighting the critical role of sanitation in malaria prevention.

- # Recommendations
- Improve access to sanitation: Countries with poor sanitation (0–30%) had the highest average incidence rates. Expanding clean water, hygiene, and waste management infrastructure can significantly reduce malaria transmission.
- Focus on rural health programs: Most high-case countries are rural-majority, indicating the need for targeted interventions such as mosquito net distribution, indoor spraying, and mobile clinics.
- Plan for peak periods: Malaria cases surged sharply between 2013 and 2017, with the highest in 2017. Monitoring trends and planning for seasonal surges is essential for resource allocation.
- Prioritize high-incidence countries: Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, and Central African Republic had the highest incidence rates. These countries should be prioritized for funding and malaria control efforts.
- Encourage urban development as a long-term strategy: Urban-majority countries showed significantly lower malaria cases. Gradual urbanization, along with improved living conditions, can help lower transmission.
- Address mixed urban–rural challenges: Countries with a balanced urban-rural population recorded the highest average malaria cases. These areas require tailored interventions that bridge both urban and rural needs.
- Invest in education and awareness: Community engagement and behavior change programs on malaria prevention and treatment are vital to reducing new infections.

# Final thoughts
This analysis shows that malaria is not just a health issue, but a complex interplay of urbanization, sanitation, and poverty. A data-driven, targeted approach can drastically reduce cases and accelerate Africa's journey toward malaria elimination.
